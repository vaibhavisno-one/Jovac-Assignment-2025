    "The Solitary Reaper" is a lyric by English Romantic poet William Wordsworth, and one of his best-known works. The poem was 
    inspired by him and his sister Dorothy's stay at the village of Strathyre in the parish of Balquhidder in Scotland in September 
    1803. <br><br>
    "The Solitary Reaper" is one of Wordsworth's most famous post-Lyrical Ballads lyrics. The words of the reaper's song are 
    incomprehensible to the speaker, so his attention is free to focus on the tone, expressive beauty and the blissful mood it creates in 
    him. The poem functions to "praise the beauty of music and its fluid expressive beauty", the "spontaneous overflow of powerful 
    feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity" that Wordsworth identified at the heart of poetry.
